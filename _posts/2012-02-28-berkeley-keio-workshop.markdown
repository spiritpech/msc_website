<p>Yesterday we welcomed Prof. Katsura and his research group from Keio University for the 1st International Workshop between UC Berkeley and Keio University. We heard 10 great speakers give presentations on their research. We then wrapped up the day with a pizza party in our newly renovated office. (Pictures of our new office coming soon!)</p>
