<p>The MSC Lab is pleased to announce that the renovation of our office in 2103 Etcheverry is finally complete! Our lab members dedicated many hours of labor assembling furniture and organizing journals. We now have all-new desks and chairs, in addition to new paint and carpet. Check out the photos below or stop by sometime to see for yourself!</p>
