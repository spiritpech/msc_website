## A Short Course on Modern PID Control

By Prof. Shankar P. Bhattacharyya


### Abstract

In this course we describe recent results on PID control that describe a new approach to design. Specifically we develop procedures to compute the complete stabilizing set. This is based on fundamental new results on root counting based on the Hermite-Bieler Theorem and its generalization. The computational algorithm that results is a linear programming problem with a nesting parameter. The stabilizing sets are shown to have certain convexity properties in specific directions.  This computation opens up the possibility of carrying out design to satisfy multiple specifications. The results are applicable to continuous time systems with and without delays, and to discrete time systems. In addition it is shown that they also allow design for a plant described by frequency response measurements without first developing an identified model.
