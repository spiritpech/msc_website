The total amount of NBC donation is $27366.05, this is different from
previous amount $26246.77.

The checks deposited in BCSSA is 
8867 + 14625.02 + 1315 + 3040.75 + 100 = 27,947.77

The returned check value is 
93.72 + 400 + 9 + 40 + 53 -20 + 6=581.72,

so the net result is 27366.05.

In YI Li's cost list, under News Media, there is one more item:
Phone $40.50, (Yao Naxin). So the expense is total 25245.43.

The left over is 2120.62. This will be the money transfered to CAF.
