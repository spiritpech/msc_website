 A number of Chinese groups took out an ad in yesterday's New York Times protesting
against comments by NBC announcer Bob Costas about China's record on human rights and
its athletes' use of performance-enhancing drugs. Costas, NBC's host for the Atlanta
Olympics, mentioned those and other sources of U.S.-Chinese tensions during the
opening ceremony of the Games. China's state-run media and foreign ministry officials
had criticized the sportscaster for the remarks, made during the July 19 broadcast,
and NBC Sports issued an apology on Aug. 22. The ad again protested against Costas's
remarks as unprofessional and biased, and asked that he deliver a sincere and public
apology.
