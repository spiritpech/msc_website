TO: Whom It May Concern 
FROM: Kai Chen, Chairman of Protesting NBC Headquarter Committee
SUBJECT: Headquarter Committee Dismissed from today on
DATE: August 27, 1996

As all of you have already known, protesting NBC campaign has accomlished the
following goals since its start one month ago: 

	1) 7.26: Sent out the 1st protesting letter signed by 5,000 on July
	   26th.
	2) 7.29: Sent out the 2nd protesting letter signed by 60 Org. repres.
	   60,000 on July 29th (100 pages of signatures)
	3) 7/30: original call for donation for Chinese/English ADs were sent
	   out by BCSSA/UCSF. (This action is thought to finally resulted in
	   NBC's apology on 8.20).  
	4) 8.4-6: Posted Full-page ADs on Chinese newspapers nationwide.
        5) 8.13: Rejected NBC's offer to withdraw the Washington Post AD
	6) 8.14: Posted first English AD on Washinton Post (which attracts
	   quite some news media attention)
	7) 8.16: A new nationwide committee formed to handled the negotiation
	   and strategy issues in order to pressure NBC to apologize.
 	8) 8.17: Dialogue with NBC resumed upon NBC's request;
	9) 8.17: Demand letter which better specify our reasons and goals of
	   protesting NBC was sent to NBC.
 	10) 8.20: NBC sent their apology letter to the Committee.
	11) 8.21: The committee has demanded NBC's apology on air. 
	12) 8.22-8.25: NBC's apology to us has been publicized by almost all
	    major news media in both US and China: Associated Press, CNN, USA
	    Today, Washington Times, NY TIMES, LA Times, (more than 15 American
	    Newspapers carried the news), People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency,
	    China News Agency, Can Kao Xiao Xi, CCTV, World Journal....... to
	    name a few. 

Given above facts, it is fair to say that current Headquarter Committee of
Protesting NBC has accomplished all of its objects set at the begining (7/24
or 7/30 or even 8/16 when this nationwide Committee was formed). Further
pressing NBC to publicize the apology on air is now continued by the New York
Times fund rasing committee.

Based on this committee's vote, I, current Chairman of the committee, formally 
announce that from this day on (8/27/96), this "Protesting NBC Headquarter 
Committee" is dismissed. 

This by no means implies that members of this Headquarter Committee do not
want to carry on any more actions against NBC. 

This committee greatly appreciate your support that has resulted in NBC's
apology.  The job is well done. The goals we set in our original calls of
protesting (7/24) and donation for AD (on 7/30) have all achieved. I am sure
that your new supports on new goals set by new leadership will be greatly
appreciated. 

Thank you so much for your support again.
