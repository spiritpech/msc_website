On behalf of the BCSSA executive committee, I formally annouonce that the
donation drive for protesting NBC called and organized by BCSSA has been
stoped since August 27. We will announce our financial report on WWW soon. 

New York Time AD Fund Raising Committee led by Harvard CSSA continues to 
work for the AD on the New York Times.

Any one who is interested in supporting the New York Time AD which may be
posted in one week or so can directly contact their committee. Names of
BCSSA/UCSF and Headquarter Committee will not be on the AD. As the result
of collaboration between BCSSA/UCSF representated nearly 100,000 people
campaign and NYT AD Committee, BCSSA has already transfered $11,000 to the
NYT AD Committee on Aug. 28. 

Since 8/28, any collaboration between BCSSA and any other Orgs. or
individuals on this matter, in any sense (organization, financce,
coordination), has been terminated. 

BCSSA want this be known publicly. 

We greatly appreciate all the help you have provided that resulted in the
historic victory. More acknowledgement to organizations and individuals
will be announced later. 

Thank you.
