From: Lee Zhang (Harvard CSSA)

Dear Friends,

If you sent your donation for NYT AD to Berkeley, you can be assured the
fund will only be used for paying NYT AD and BCSSA will transfer the
remaining balance to NYT AD Committee.  If you wish to support the
continuing campaign, please send your donation to:

Ying Huang
542 West 112th St #5C
New York, NY 10025
(pay to the order of HCSSA)
In the memo, please specify "For NYT AD"

In any case if there is fund reamining after the expenses for NYT AD is
paid, you will be informed immeditely and we will make a public notice to
stop donation drive. And you have the right to decide where the remaining
fund should be sent to. Once again you can be assured HCSSA and BCSSA will
not take any donation fund for its own organization use. As BCSSA will
present the accounts to the public soon, HCSSA will do the same for your
surpervision as soon as we receive the fund from Berkeley and Columbia.
One suggestion from some of our supporters is to send the reamining (if it
happens) to mainland China for the flood disaster.

BCSSA supports all of us from the begining of this campaign and let's
thank them all at Berkeley for their dedication, unselfishness and
committment.  We will contact Kai Chen further to transfer the incoming
donation fund for its proper use.

Sincerely Yours,

Lee Zhang

(On behalf of NYT AD Committee)
