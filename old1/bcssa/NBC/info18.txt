From: Lee Zhang (Harvard CSSA)

Dear Sir/Madam, 

On September 1, 1996, there will be a protest advertisement in the main
section of the New York Times Sunday edition.

The 1/4 page advertisement is titled "Costas Poisoned Olympic Spirit,
Public Protest NBC". The advertisement was made possible by donations from
thousands of individuals and the support of millions of people worldwide.
We are grateful for the generous help from many of our American friends.

With this ad, we are not seeking to foment hatred or to agitate a fight.
Through this advertisement, we hope to be able to build consensus among
people of different backgrounds on what kinds of behaivors are not
acceptable, and to prevent such an unfortunate situation from happening
again. As well, we hope that Mr. Bob Costas will have the courage and
decency to apologize for his wrongdoing.

For a preview of the image and texts of the ad, please visit

Please spread the word to as many people as possible and please inform
your friends who don't have internet access.

Sincerely yours,

New York Times Advertisement Committee
