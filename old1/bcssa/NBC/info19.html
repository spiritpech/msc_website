<H1>Bob Costas Denied Possibility of Apology</H1>
<p>
<font size=4>
Bob Costas of NBC appeared on NBC's "<I>Tonight Show with Jay Leno</I>"
on Thursday, August 29 night.
<hr><p>
Bob Costas clarified that NBC never apologized for his comments
during the Olympic coverage.  Costas and NBC do not intend to 
apologize in the future.  
<p>
Costas further stated that Markey sent a letter(*) only as a friendly 
gesture, and it was misrepresented as an apology to the public.
<p>
Second, as for his comments on China's human rights condition during the
Olympic opening ceremony, Costas said they are factual and <B>pertinent</B>.
He cited the fact that several US congressmen wrote to American members
of IOC committee to vote against China's bid to host 2000's Olympic Games
in Beijing, as the evidence that his comments on China's human rights
were pertinent.
<p>
He also suggested that those who are protesting his comments simply 
have not been exposed to media which tells <B>truth</B>.
<p>
Third, Costas said he had no bias against Chinese atheletes by 
mentioning names of Fu Mingxia, Li Xiaoshuang, and Le Jingyi.  He
once again said that his comments on alleged drug use among Chinese
swimmers were legitimate, since several Chinese swimmers were caught
using drugs in 94, their performance at this Olympics is way below
those in the 94 World Championship (one gold versus 12 gold medals.)
<p>
However, it was fairly clear that he was suggesting that the Chinese 
swimmers who came this time were caught before, thus his comments were 
warranted.  And that is totally false.  I believe Le Jinyi, Liu Limin,
and Lin Li are only ones from the previous Chinese swimming team that
came to this Olympics, and all of them have won medals this time.
<p>
Fourth, Costas also used other subtle examples to distort the situation
as well.  He mentioned someone was upset because he said "George on 
my mind" is a "hokey song" while what he said was something totally
different.  That upset viewer simply misinterpreted him, or rather
that person could not understand English very well and thus was making
wrong accusation against him.  In fact, defending himself on Tonight
Show itself is a delibarate act to suggest that your guys simply are 
too sensitive and can not take any jokes.
