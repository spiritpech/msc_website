Chinese organizations demand Costas apology

NEW YORK - A number of Chinese groups took out an ad in Sunday's New York
Times protesting the comments of Bob Costas about China's Olympic team.
Costas, NBC's Olympic host, mentioned China's human rights record and
other sources of U.S.-Chinese tensions during the opening ceremony of the
Atlanta Olympics. China's state-run media and Foreign Ministry officials
had criticized the sportscaster for the remarks, made during the July 19
broadcast, and NBC Sports issued an apology on Aug. 22. According to an
NBC transcript, Costas said: "Every economic power, including the United
States, wants to tap into that huge potential market, but of course there
are problems with human rights, property rights disputes, the threat posed
to Taiwan." In Beijing, the apology appeared to do little to mollify those
offended by Costas' comments, which were widely perceived in China as
openly anti-Chinese.
