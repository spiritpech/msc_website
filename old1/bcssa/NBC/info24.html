  Despite NBC saying Bob Costas meant no ill will toward
China when he mentioned during the Olympics opening 
ceremonies that Chinese swimmers had been disqualified for 
performance-enhancing drugs, Chinese groups have continued 
to place ads in U.S. papers demanding an apology from
Costas and NBC.
<p>
  "It's bizarre," NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol says,
"because no one has questioned the accurancy of Bob's remarks.
NBC said it was sorry if anybody felt bad, but the bottom
line is Bob's remarks were completely based on factual and
pertinent events.
<p>
  "We live in a democracy, and when an announcer deservedly
is as respected as Costas is, we should prize their accuracy."
