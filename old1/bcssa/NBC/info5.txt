TO: News Media
FROM: Kai Chen, Chairman of Protesting NBC Headquarter Committee
SUBJECT: NBC Aologized 
DATE: 1PM, PST, August 20, 1996 

        NBC apologized for the "hurt feelings" resulting from "the comments 
made by Bob Costas on NBC's coverage of the Altanta Olypics Opening Ceremony."  
The apology, signed by Ed Markey, vice president of NBC Sports Press, was made 
in response to our organized protest of Chinese and Chinese American groups 
representing approximately 70,000 people against NBC commentator Bob Costas' 
hostile remarks towards many international athletes, particularly Chinese athletes.     
NBC failed to respond to the two protesting letters submitted to them on 
July 27th and July 30th, until a Washington Post AD was to be posted on August 14th. 
 
        We have faxed our response to the apology to Mr. Markey informing him that 
while we appreciated NBC's effort to resolve this situation,  we cannot accept 
its apology in its present form.  We demanded the apology be made on air 
during prime evening hours.

Ms. Wei Qun E
VIA FAX

Dear Ms. E:

I am in receipt of a letter from Mr. Kai Chen designating you as the representative
of the Chinese and Chinese American groups concerned with comments made by Bob Costas
on NBC's coverage of the Atlanta Olympics Opening Ceremony.

Mr. Costas did not intend any disrespect to the People's Republic of China or its
citizens. The comments made were not based on NBC beliefs. Nobody at NBC ever intends
to offend anyone, and we regret that this has apparently happened. We apologize for
any resulting hurt feelings and we sicerely hope this puts the matter to rest.

Sincerely,


Ed Markey
VP, Sports Press
