NBC has apologized to Chinese groups for BOB COSTAS's mention of China's

claer that we didn't intend to hurt their feelings," ED MARKEY, an NBC
Sports vice president, said yesterday.

According to an NBC trascripts, Costas said, "Every economic power,
including the United States, wants to tap into that huge potential market,
but of courase there are problems with human rights, property rights
disputes, the threat posed to Taiwan." Costas was on vacation and
unavailable for comment yesterday, Markey said.

industrial enterprises in China, with hundreds of millions of dollars
invested in areas such as lighting, plastics and medical equipment. Asked
whether G.E.'s corporate interests were taken into consideration in
issuing the apology, Markey said, "Not as far as I was concerned."
