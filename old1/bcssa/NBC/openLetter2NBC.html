Open Letter to NBC

<hr>
NBC President or CEO: <p>

	We, 60 organizations and 2,300 individuals representing a total of nearly 70,000
Chinese students, scholars, engineers, entrepreneurs, other professionals and people as
well as over 300 businesses in the San Francisco Bay Area, other areas of north America
and the world, are writing this letter to you concerning some comments made by NBC
commentators during the Atlanta summer Olympic games, especially the one made by Mr. Bob
Costas on Chinese team in the opening ceremony.  <p>

	It is known that the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games marks the first time that all
members of the International Olympic Committee come together for an athletic festival.  A
record number of nations proudly joined the "Parade of Nations"  in this non-boycott
Olympic summer event.  Unfortunately, at this grand moment of celebrating friendship and
unison among the human-beings from different corners of the earth, NBC commentator Bob
Costas unprofessionally spread rumors on athletes from the People's Republic of China.
<p> [quote] "With an economy growing at the rate of about 10% a year, every economic
power, including United States, wants to tap into that huge potential markets.  But, of
course, there are problems with human rights, copyright disputes, and the threat posed to
Taiwan. And within the Olympics, while they have excelled, they were 4th in the medal
standings in Barcelona, with 54 medals, 16 of them gold, this after a 30-year absence
which ended in 1984, they've excelled athletically, they built into a power, bu t amid
suspicions, Dick, especially concerning their track athletes and their female swimmers
possibly using performance-enhancing drugs.  None caught in Barcelona, but since those
games of 1992, several have been caught." [End quote] <p>


We hereby strongly protest against Mr. Costas' unprofessional, irresponsible and
provocative remarks! <p>

	The Olympic Games is, without a doubt, a global event aimed to promote peace and
friendship between the nations, and to welcome the world to a fair competition on sports
instead of political or economic power.  It is probably the only grand event that
brings the world together over all barriers, where athleticism overcomes politics,
friendship overcomes hostility, comradeship overcomes disagreement.  On such an occasion,
it is inappropriate to make unfriendly and even offensive comments on other countries. 
The Olympics is simply not a place to horn one's skills as a political commentator.  We
regard Mr. Costas' performance as an ignorant departure from the Olympic spirit. <p>

	Furthermore, the frequent references to the "suspicion" on athletes from
countries other than U.S. by Mr. Costas and several other commentators were biased,
irresponsible and provocative.  Such comments occurred not only in the opening ceremony
but also during the Olympics coverage.<p> 

	As a matter of fact, for decades, the Chinese athletes as a whole have been 
one of the cleanest in the world, as compared to some major nations. The Chinese National
Bureau of Athletics have been very strict on drug regulations.  If an athlete is caught
on any occasion, he or she will be immediately banned from all competitions in national
meets, let alone in international meets, which was the situation after some Chinese
swimmers were tested positive during 1994 Asian Athletic Games.  <p>

	Without evidence, it is inappropriate for professional commentators to declare on
a top-rating national broadcast that the whole team "might" "widespreadly" use drugs. 
Any suspicious broadcaster on a national TV network should be substantiated by fact. 

Speculations on Chinese track athletes and beyond are groundless. As a matter of fact,
among all Chinese medalists on the 1992 Olympics and all Chinese athletes on the 1996
Olympics, no one has ever been tested positive on prohibited drugs.  <p>

	The unfair comments were not only made to Chinese athletes, but also to other
countries.  We feel compelled to believe a double standard is used on athletes from
different nations.  In recent years, athletes from a number of countries have been
implicated in drug use, including two most recent cases involving American and Australian
athletes.  However, these didn't seem to be of any interest to the NBC commentators. 
After an Irish swimmer grabbed a gold medal from a famous USA swimmer, some NBC anchors
placed "suspicion" on her as well.  We were disappointed at such irresponsible and
discriminating comments on other countries, and sincerely hope the NBC commentators would
try their best to assume the responsibility as a major national TV network and maint ain
objectivity in sports coverage.  <p>

The Olympics is a magnificent event that draws the world together.  For the
United States, the Centennial Olympics is a rare opportunity to reach out and extend
their traditional hospitality to their guests.  We were impressed by the spectacular
performances of
 the opening ceremony and the enthusiasm from the audience, while awaiting the
city of Atlanta's improvement in providing a nicer environment (i.e., better food, fewer
traffic jams, no more false fire alarms in athletic dorms as late as AM in the morning)
for every athlete to perform his/her best.  <p>

	We appreciate the hard work of NBC in the TV coverage throughout the week.
However, the inappropriate and offensive conduct of Mr. Costas and some other commentators
have inevitably done damage to the aura of NBC as a major broadcast network and USA as a
country - Whether or not their comments were intentional; Whether or not their opinions
reflected the view of NBC.  <p>

	<strong>We are hereby strongly demanding a public apology from Mr. Costas or NBC!
</strong> 

<p> Sincerely,
