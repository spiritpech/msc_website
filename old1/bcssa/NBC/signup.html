Please support us by <strong>signing up</strong> the folowing
supporting list by <strong> mailing your name (first, last), work/study unit, and
e-mail address (optional) to <a
href=http://mendel.berkeley.edu/~wzh/signature.html> 
an automatic register form</a>.</strong> <p>

<strong>The deadline for submitting your signatures by e-mail to us is 5:00pm
7/26/1996</strong>.  After the time, your signature by e-mail to
bcssa@mechatro2.me.berkeley.edu will not be guaranteed to be put in the supporting list,
because of our extremely limited human power (only one webmaster) on updating the list. 
However, you are encouraged to <a href=http://mendel.berkeley.edu/~wzh/signature.html>
sign up at our automatic register form </a> whenever you like. We will put as many as we
can and as soon as possible. <strong> There is no deadline for <a
href=mailto:bcssa@mechatro2.me.berkeley.edu>signing up in the name of organizations</a>
by e-mail. </strong><p>
