<center><h2> Progress summary (8/13)  
</h2></center>
<hr>
In the past two weeks, BCSSA, coordinated with other Orgs. such as
SCEA, CSSAs from UCSF, Staford, UC Davis, and with the generous help
from people across the world, have achieved the following on the NBC issue:
<p>
Our first letter, co-signed by nearly 5,500 people and 11 Orgs. was
 sent to NBC as early as 7/26. The second letter was endorsed by over
 60 organizations representing a total of nearly 70,000 people around the world
 plus an additional 2,700 individuals was sent to NBC on July 30,
 with 100 pages of signatures!
 Up to now, there are 65 CSSAs and other Orgs. endorse the letter.
<p>
Great news media work and coverage:
 Since we announced our call for signature on July 25, our progresses
 have become top stories for national and local news coverage
 (of Chinese media) for almost everyday up to now. TV Channel 26,
 Radio 1450, 1500, and all 3 major Chinese newspapers (World Journal,
 Sing Tao Daily and QIao Bao) have covered our stories or published our
 statements almost EVERYDAY.
<p>
Donation campaign to run full page ADS across the country:
 When protesting went low in late July, BCSSA proposed a call for
 donation to post ADs nation wide. This receives very enthusiastic
 responses from people all over the N. America and world.<p>

Great Donation Drive Achieved:
 In one week, BCSSA/UCSF alone, by fully making use of internet/www
 and Chinese news media, has raised nearly $12,000 (promised by email)!
 After the news about BCSSA and newspaper AD posted nation wide,
 three donation hotlines of BCSSA have been jumped off hooks all day long
 from 6AM to late evening.
<p>
Successfully bring in help at Critical areas:
 With the help of World Journal and professional AD agents, non-profit
 organizations of SF, volunteers with special talent, we have successfully
 posted full page ads on Chinese news media nation wide on last Tues. (8/6)
 on W. Coast and Thus. (8/8) on east coast. A space on America's most prestigious
 newspaper, Washington Post, has been reserved since 8/5th. The negociation
 to post the AD has been ongoing since then (their lawers are examining the
 content to avoid any legal issue NBC may impose on their newspaper).
 THE GOOD NEWS JUST ARRIVED: THEY ACCEPT OUR AD AND WILL POST IT ON their
 best edition - the main news section (A-sec.) this Wed., 8/14! World Journal
 (Shi Jie Daily) will carry more details of our progresses tomorrow (8/13)
 on the AD stories on their National News Section (A-edition)!!
<p>
Communication channel between BCSSA and NBC has been established:  
 After numerous calls, BCSSA has finally esablished a communication channel
 with NBC's officials. NBC's reponse to our protesting letter may be announced
 by the end of this week (8/16). BCSSA will continue to push a specific
 answer from NBC on our particular letter to them.
