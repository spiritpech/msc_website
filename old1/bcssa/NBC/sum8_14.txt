New progresses on the NBC issue: 

1) 8AM PSTime, NBC saw the AD on Washington Post and NBC VP sent in a fax to
   express disappointment and request further talks.

   Many Americans who read the AD called in to express either friendship
   or respect to China/Chinese or request further details on NBC's comments.

   A cover letter to be distributed with Mr. Costas' comments to American people 
   who requested further info. on the matter is being written. 

   Upon NBC's request, further negotiation with NBC is to be resumed today.

2) NBC's Vice President (VP) of NBC's Sports Press urgently contacted Kai Chen 
   yesterday to negotiate conditions to withdraw or postpond our planed AD 
   on Washington Post. After more than one hour's intense negotiation with NBC 
   on the phone (Kai was in a Monterey Hotel attending an International Conference 
   and gave presentation on his research) and discussions with related parties 
   (Washington Post, BCSSA's consultant, etc), Kai Chen, on behalf of the world wide
   effort, rejected NBC's request at 4:20PM eastern time.

   Part of justifications on our decision to reject NBC's proposal
   is reported on today's (Wed., 8.14)) World Journal (Shi Jie Daily).

   We have noticed and welcome NBC high officials' attitude change from
   totally ignoring our concerns to urgently seeking an agreement.
   But we only accept sincere apology. No tactics.

3) Our AD appears today (8.14.96, Wed.) on US's most presitigious newspaper -
   Washington Post on the main news (A-) section, as planned!

4) We have achieved our goals we set at the begining for the protest and ad:
   a) Make our voice heard by millions of people;
   b) Let Mr. Bob Costas of NBC learn a lesson from you.
