                   BCSSA New Student Assistance Project 97

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

About the project

BCSSA start the project formally from Summer, 1996. Li Yi and Kai Chen, with
other BCSSA fellows such as Zhihua Shen, to name but a few, initiated it and
helped some newcomers with their settling down at their first days in US.
Many volunteers participated in the project in 1996. Click here to see what
was going on then and who the volunteers are and who are helped. We hope the
Berkeley Chinese community could form a good tradition on this mutual
assistance project and carry it on in the future.

How the project is working

* Call for Volunteers (5/24/97)
     Could you please help? BCSSA calls for volunteers to help the new
     students. BCSSA is a non-profit, volunteer based student organization.
     Its income comes from several parties held during the academic year and
     is used for Berkeley Chinese students and scholars only. No position in
     BCSSA is a paid one. The NSA project rely on volunteers. Without our
     Chinese fellows's participation, BCSSA can do nothing. Please help!

* Volunteers Information
     Current Volunteers (7/27/97) Who they are. Here are some information
     about them. Some of them can pickup newcomers from the airport; some
     can do peer advising and provide temporary housing; some can do both.
     Feel free to contact them or BCSSA if you need help.

Special Notes to Newcomers

  1. BCSSA New student orientation on 8/17/97 Sunday

  2. To students and scholars already in US or Canada

          Because of the extreme lack of man power and the limited volunteer
          resource, BCSSA has to put the newcomers from CHINA at its first
          priority to help. We expect you are more independent than those
          just come from CHINA, because we belive that you are much more
          familiar with the transportation system in US and the country's
          culture.

          We understand that you may feel inconvenient without help. But we
          strongly suggest you do some research on how to get to Berkeley
          from the airport and how to find housing at Berkeley before your
          arrival. BCSSA is happy to provide this information to you upon
          request. Actually, all the relevant information can be found in
          BCSSA's web or somewhere else in the internet.

          This does not mean BCSSA is reluctant to help you. Feel free to
          contact us whenever you need help, please. If you have enough
          volunteers, we certainly will help you. Please also keep in touch
          with us, since you are becoming a member of our BCSSA family.

  3. How to go to Berkeley from San Francisco Airport

          The public transportation is convenient at Bay area. Usually, it
          can cost less than $6 to get to Berkeley by BUS and BART(subway)
          or $16 by door to door shuttle. Please take advantege of these
          service if you could.

          By Bus and BART(Bay Area Rapid Transit)
          * Take SamTrans Bus Route 3X to Colma BART station. SFO SamTrans
          Stops: International Termianl (D) and North Terminal: Upper Level,
          Center Island. When you arrive, you are at the lower level. You
          need to go upstairs to the upper level (Departure level). If you
          are not sure where you should go, ask the information desk about
          BUS and BART to Berkeley. The Bus comes every 20-30 min. from 6am
          to 9pm. DamTrans 1-800-660-4287. Fare: $1.00 Tell the bus driver
          you will go to Colma BART station.
          * Take BART from Colma to Bereley. Buy ticket at the automatic
          ticket machine outside the BART station. It costs about $3 to
          Berkeley station. Before you enter the BART station, you can take
          some free booklet about BART and free BUS/BART map of the bay
          area. When you are in the BART station, be sure to take the
          RICHMOND bound train and get off at Berkeley station. The stations
          before Berkeley are Ashby and MaArther. Do not go outside the BART
          station when you transfer from one train to anther one. The money
          will be deducted from your magnetic card ticket when you reach
          your destination and the amount is based on the distance you
          travelled. So if you are lost in BART, do not worry, you will
          reach berkeley anyway. Just ask, there are only four lines of the
          BART in bay area.

          By Door to Door Shuttle * Strongly recommended if you have heavy
          luggages. For about $16, they will send you to everywhere in
          Berkeley. Door-to-Door Van Shuttle Service, stops at upper level,
          venter island, outside of airline ticket counters, all terminals.
          BAYPORTER EXPRESS, every hour 6:30am to 11:30pm, Red sign, Green
          color Van, 1-800-287-6783 or 1-415-467-1800. $13-$35 depending on
          distance, about $16 to Berkeley everywhere. Tips extra for driver
          if he help you move your luggages. When you arrive, first ask the
          information desk about the BAYPORTER EXPRESS to Berkeley, you will
          be given a sheet and the direction to the shuttle stops. You will
          go upstairs to the departure level, do outside to the steet and
          the center island. Wait and signal when you see BAYPORTER EXPRESS
          comes. Tell the driver the address you will will go and just sit
          and rest until you reach the destination (and pay, of course:).

  4. Where should you wait if you are waiting for someone to pick you up?

          * Please prepare a big sign (hard paper) with your Chinese and
          English names printed on it and put it on your luggage cart when
          you go out from the custom. When you go out, you will see a lot of
          people (or few in afternoon) waiting. In front of you is the
          telephone both. Right to you is the currency exchange both and
          information desk. Ask question at the information desk if you have
          any. There are many seats at your right side which are for waiting
          people. There is a step elevator up to the arrival level and down
          to the parking lot. Do not go upstairs or downstairs. Go
          astraight, and you will pass the automatic door and see the
          street. There are two seats at your left hand side. Wait there
          until the one who supposed to show up to find you. Be sure your
          name sign is in your cart. Do not worry if you wait for some time.
          It takes 50min from Berkeley to SFO and there is often trafic jam
          on the highway. If you wait more than 1 hour, call someone you
          know or us (BCSSA members). Please take a note of my (Li Yi) home
          phone (510)586-0227 and my work phone (510)642-0935. From SFO, you
          need to dial "1"first before you dial 510-XXX-XXXX to Berkeley.
          This costs about 50 cents and you can get change from the change
          machine in the airport. Do not leave your luggage cart alone when
          you do something else.

  5. Housing at Berkeley

          * First, see the homepage of housing at Berkeley provided by
          BCSSA, please.

          * Be aware that finding housing is extremely difficult if you are
          not here and at the beginning at one semester. Please come here as
          early as possible to find one by youself. When you arrive here,
          you can go directly to
          1) Internation House, where SISS is, to use its temporary room,
          about $35/day including food and room. 2299 Piedmont Ave.,
          Berkeley.

          8) Your friend or relative's place or temp place provided by BCSSA
          volunteers (subject to availability).

          In general, BCSSA does not help anyone to find housing before his
          arrival at Berkeley. BCSSA provides information about housing,
          though. Selecting housing is a big decision and very time
          consuming. BCSSA would rather try to provide temp lodging for you
          when you go searching for yourself.
