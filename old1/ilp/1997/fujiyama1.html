<H3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</H3>

<P>The optical player has made rapid and remarkable progress in the
past 10 years. In addition to CD/CD-ROM, the DVD (Digital Video Disk)
player has finally been made available to the market. As these optical
players gain in popularity, they have been utilized in various
hardware applications such as portable CD player. Presently, one major
problem of the CD-ROM/DVD players is vibration caused by the high
rotational speed of the spindle motor. In both cases, disturbance
suppression control is becoming more and more important. The object of
my research is to develop a disturbance observer for a CD player
tracking controller and to achieve an improvement in control
robustness relative to conventional controllers, which are usually PID
or lead-lag.</P>

<H3>METHODOLOGY</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Apply a disturbencs observer to CD player tracking control
  <LI>Develop the disturbance observer algorithm by using fixed-point DSP
  <LI>Evaluate the performance of the disturbance observer through simulations and experiments.
</UL>

<H3>RESULTS TO DATE</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Installed the vibration testing system
  <LI>Develop a disturbance observer simulation
  <LI>Implemented a disturbance observer with dixed-point DSP
</UL>
