<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>PIVOT FRICTION COMPENSATION USING ACCELEROMETER AND
DISTURBANCE OBSERVER FOR HARD DISK DRIVES</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Jun Ishikawa</P>

<H3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</H3>

<P>The embedded sector servo system has become common for hard disk
drives (HDDs) with higher track densities. In this servo system, servo
information is embedded in circular data tracks at equally spaced
angles, i.e., sectors, so that the magnetic head may be controlled
directly relative to the target track. The number of serctors should
be minimized for securing the maximum data storage area, but this will
lower the sampling frequency for digital control based on position
error feedback. Thus, it is a challenge to design a controller which
provides a necessary positioning accuracy to match the track density
at low frequency sampling of the error. While disk manufacturers have
successfully utilized modern approaches such as model following
control and multi-rate control to achieve the goal, an obstacle for
further enhancement of performance is represented by nonlinearities
and uncertainties in the drive unit such as pivot friction. This
research will present a friction compensator using the combination of
accelerometer and disturbance observer.</P>

<H3>METHODOLOGY</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Estimate the pivot friction torque using the scaled voice coil
       motor (VCM) current and the scaled carriage arm acceleration
       (Disturbance Observer).
  <LI>Linearize the dynamics between the VCM current, <I>c</I>, and
       the carriage arm acceleration, <I>a</I>, to be a constant gain
       within an observer bandwidth by feeding back the filter output,
       which is the friction estimate, into a VCM amplifier (Friction
       Compensator).
  <LI>Design the low pass filter in Fig.JI-1 using the stocahstic
       estimation theory (Kalman Filter). See Fig.JI-2 for the whole
       configuration of the friction compensator.
  <LI>Implement the proposed observer as an analog system to enlarge
       the observer bandwidth and reduce the load on a lower sampling rate
       positioning loop.

<H3>RESULTS TO DATE</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Showed by simulatioin that the mechanical nonlinearity resulting
       form pivot friction can be eliminated by the proposed method.
       <UL>
	 <LI>The mechanical system under the influence of friction
	      exhibits varying low frequency gain depending on the input magnitude,
	      or more precisely depending on the carriage arm displacement (Fig.JI-3
	      a). This kind of perturbation causes not only the gain reduction at
	      frequencies, but also critical modeling errors for model-based
	      control.
	 <LI>The pivot friction compensator linearized the
	      characteristics of the mechanical system as a double integrator, i.e.,
	      as a pure inertia system, no matter what the input magnitude was
	      (Fig.JI-3 b).
       </UL>
  <LI>Investigate the practicality of the proposed approach by experimentation.
