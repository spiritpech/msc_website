<p>From the mechanical design point of view, maximizing the payload to
manipulator inertia ratio is desirable. This can be done by using a gear
reduction mechanism to allow for a smaller (and less expensive) actuator.
The particular configuration of interest uses a Harmonic Drive (HD) and a
brushless DC motor. Harmonic Drives are very compact and have a very high
gear reduction ratio. In the previous talks, issues associated with using
this configuration (such as Coulomb Friction and compliance) have been
discussed.

<p>This talk will focus on the compensation of actuator saturation. When
either the desired payload to manipulator inertia ratio or the desired
bandwidth is increased, actuator saturation becomes a limiting factor.
Ignoring saturation in the design process may result in undesirable limit
cycles, avoiding saturation may result in the inability to achieve the
desired goal.

<p>One class of approach called Linear Conditioning (LC) appends additional
controller which uses the difference between demanded and achieved
actuation as the input. The idea is to reduce the performance degradation
due to saturation.

<p>Weston & Poslethwaithe proposed a generalized structure that allows for an
intuitive view of the LC approach. The implementation is done by first
designing a controller that stabilizes the system without saturation, and
then adding an LC compensator. In this talk, an additional requirement
that the first controller does not induce limit cycles is imposed. This
reduces both the set of stabilizing controllers as well as the "burden" to
the LC compensator. To this date, an objective performance measure is yet
to be proposed.
