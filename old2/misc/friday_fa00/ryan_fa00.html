<p>Autonomous following of heavy vehicles has the potential to greatly
reduce the costs of operating platoons of trucks. Computer
controlled following allows a vehicle to follow another vehicle at close
range, increasing the gas mileage of trucks within the platoon and
alleviating some problems related to driver fatigue. A visual system
developed by UCLA, IRIS-2 (Infrared Ranging via Image Subtraction), is
installed on the following vehicle and is used to obtain the relative
position and relative yaw to the preceding vehicle.  The autonomous 
following problem must be defined properly for analysis and design of control
algorithms.  

<p>The heavy vehicle model used is similar to the magnetometer-based control
model, except that the road-reference frame is not practical for
following. The unsprung mass model (origin at tractor CG) is used for
the autonomous following model, but two vehicles are necessary for the
problem definition. The relative lateral displacement and yaw between
vehicles are modeled in terms of the states of the following vehicle, and
the effect of motion by the preceding vehicle is treated as a disturbance
to these relative parameters. 

<p>The problem of tracking a vehicle's trajectory using IRIS-2 without
inter-vehicle communication is investigated.  Maximizing the ability of
a single vehicle to track the trajectory of the preceding vehicle will
minimize the propagation of errors throughout a platoon of trucks.
Two techniques are proposed for tracking the preceding vehicle's
trajectory.  The first method ensures that the following vehicle
forward velocity vector is always pointing toward the rear of the
preceding trailer.  The second method assumes that the following vehicle
will travel at constant yaw rate and longitudinal velocity over the
truck spacing distance and calculates the projected lateral error of
this circular trajectory at the truck spacing distance.  Simple,
manual loop-shaping controllers are designed to test each proposed
tracking method, and simulations are performed.
