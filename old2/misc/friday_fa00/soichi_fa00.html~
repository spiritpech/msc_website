<p>My main research interest is in the extension of numerical 
algorithms to solve the H-infinity optimization problems 
and its application to practical control-related optimization 
problems, which cannot be solved by the well-known LMI-based
(or, equivalently, Ricatti-equation-based) approach. This
talk is on the same line; this time I focus on optimal
state estimation problems. 

<p>The state observer with the observer matrix (L) optimized
in the H2 sense is well known as the Kalman filter. The H-infinity
state observer comes with the H-infinity optimal, instead of
H2 optimal, observer matrix. The idea of the H-infinity observer
is not new; it can be derived in the similar way as the Kalman
filter case. 

<p>There has not been, however, many applications of the H-infinity
observers reported in the literature, mainly because its advantage
over other (optimal) observers is not clear. In this talk, I 
propose a new "actually useful" application of the H-infinity 
optimization to observer design, along with the nonconvex 
optimization approach to solve the design problem. As an 
application example, it is applied to the fault detection filter
design for vehicle control.

<p>In the second part of the talk, I present the idea of mismatched 
state observers and the application of the H-infinity optimization
to their design. The system matrices of mismatched observers do 
not necessarily coincide with those of the plant. This type of 
state observers is not new either; it is equivalent to the general-
structure filters often used in the field of signal processing.
This talk presents its novel application to control problems. 
As an application example, it is applied to the feedback linearization
control of lateral motion of heavy-duty vehicles.
