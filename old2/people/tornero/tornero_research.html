</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Helvetica,arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800000">AREAS OF PARTICULAR EXPERTISE</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Helvetica,arial" SIZE=2><P>In terms of robotic systems, the interest is concentrated in two main areas: kinematics, dynamics, identification and control of robot manipulators; and collision detection and avoidance, motion and trajectory planning. Other areas of interest are CAD/CAM systems, auto-guided vehicles and artificial vision.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<BR>
<B>1.- Kinematics, Dynamics, Identification and Control of Robot Manipulators </P>
</B><P>The increasing performance of industrial robots requires the use of the most complete dynamic models of robot-arms. Identification and control are two essential fields in robotics. Dynamic simulation can be applied in order to analyze the behavior of both, the robot and the controller.</P>
<P>In many robot control problems, it is necessary to know the inertial parameters of the robot. Inertial parameters can be obtained by means of on-line identification using adaptive control or by applying off-line identification using the total energy theorem. For solving those problems, a linear relationship need to be generated in terms of the inertial parameters. We have developed a general procedure for obtaining the linear relation for the energy and torque equation using Lagrange-Euler formulation. In this approach several definitions and properties have been introduced in order to get a new mathematical formulation of the dynamic model for the robot-arm.</P>
<P>Conventional control and non-linear control techniques such as passivity strategies, feedback linearization, observer design and adaptive control have been developed and compared. Many of them have been implemented on educational robot arms as well as on industrial robots (e.g. Cartesian robot and robot-arm).</P>
<P>In addition, a collaboration with the Parallel Computation Group of the Computer Science Department several parallel algorithms have been implemented on different types of architectures (Systolic Arrays, Shared Memory Multi-processors and Multi-computers) in order to solve control problems. </P>
<P>&nbsp;<BR>
<B>2.- Collision Detection and Avoidance, Motion and Trajectory Planning</P>
</B><P>Trajectory and path planning in robotics systems can be described in the following hierarchical way: planning problem (higher level), collision avoidance, distance computation and object model representation (lower level). </P>
<P>Most of the developed methods for solving the above-listed sub-problems, as well as other robotic applications, use a geometric modeling of real robotic systems. </P>
<P>A novel object representation for the geometric modeling of objects, like obstacles, robot links, mobile robots, etc., in industrial robotic systems has been developed. The geometric modeling generates envelopes of minimum volume for all object in the working environment. An optimal modeler is used to envelop any real object using different types of geometries in accordance with the model requirements. This procedure is based on the Hough Transform. After having used this geometric designer, the robotic system will be ready to be used for trajectory-path planning application.</P>
<P>Based on a novel object representation technique very fast collision checking procedures have been implemented. In trajectory generation, the discrete joint space and the artificial potential fields are been considered.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<BR>
<B>3.- CAD/CAM systems </P>
</B><P>This area deals with the design and implementation of CAD/CAM systems. In particular NC-machines programming interfaces based on CAD systems are developed. Control units based on industrial computers and microprocessors are also implemented. Higher level aspects, such as shop-floor control are also considered.</P>
<P>Furthermore, several software have been developed, some of them based on commercial CAD and using C++ for Windows. This software has been now updated to include an output in international standards such as ICR, allowing interconnection between all the software developed. Special interest is being focused on in topics such as environment integration with vision systems and friend interface developing for robot programming. The software has been applied to the programming of several industrial robots such as ABB IRB L6 and IRB 1500.</P>
<P>For some of the above commented software, the first step was to obtain the kinematic model the robot-arm as well as the whole flexible cell. For this purpose, a specific package has been developed which allows to model geometrically and kinematically any kind of robotic system, with its simulation. All the results (elements, links, direct and inverse kinematics resolution) can be transported to the software of previous section.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<BR>
<B>4.- Control of Auto-guided Vehicles: </P>
</B><P>This area is focused on the application of previously defined areas such as modeling, identification and control and motion planing to these particular problem.</P>
<P>The AGV Robouter II is a mobile robot from Robosoft. On this vehicle several applications has been developed concerning to adaptive control, sensor integration, path planing (artificial potential fields and road map), control and Architecture, and teleoperation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<BR>
<B>5.-Artificial Vision: </P>
</B><P>Conventional 2D-computer vision and image processing techniques, on gray level or color images, for tasks involving feature extraction, object detection and object classification. Also applications requiring non-contact measurement and Automatic Visual Inspection have been developed. Several works have been carried out on 3D computer vision techniques for range map estimation and pattern recognition and unsupervised learning techniques.</P>
<P>In particular, there is especial experience on</P>
<P>- Inspection and quality control.<BR>
- Identification and pattern-recognition.<BR>
- 3D Modeling and estereoscopic vision.<BR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Helvetica,arial" SIZE=2><P>We are especially interested in model identification and control, computer aided robot programming and monitoring, motion planning" for robot arms and mobile robots.</P>
<P>In terms of dynamic modeling and identification, we have developed efficient algorithms based on theoretical approach. We are applying conventional and non-linear control technique to several educational and industrial robots. </P>
<P>Related to motion planning, integration of robot environment with different sensors to develop techniques for collision- avoidance is a main objective of the research group. Methods for robot-arms and environment modeling to make collision-detection and distance computation easier and faster is another of the group goals. </P>
<P>Several planning techniques at different levels ( path, trajectory and task are being developed and applied on both, robot arms and AGVs. </P>
<P>In terms of computer aided robot programming and monitoring, our interest is focused on robot languages standardization process using IRL (Industrial Robot Languages) as high level languages and ICR (Intermediate Code for Robots) as lower level code. Included in this point, improving IRL to consider task and object oriented properties is one of our goals. The design and development of man-machine software interfaces for monitoring including a wide range of sensor information is also a current topic of research. </P>
<P>In computer vision, we are interested in 3D computer vision techniques suitable in applications involving object position estimation, object surface inspection, object manipulation, changing environments, collision avoiding obstacles, etc. We are also interested in pattern recognition and unsupervised learning, specifically using self-organized feature maps for image segmentation and pattern recognition in natural products like plants, fruits and food. Optical processing, optical correlation. Further techniques in computer vision, medical imaging and parallel architectures for image processing are considered. </P>
<P>We are also interested in the application of parallel computing to solve the processes from the programming to control of robots systems in the context of "High Performance Computing". It is also applicable to Computer Integrated Manufacturing Applications and other Engineering Basic Research". </P>
<P>An immediate objective is to extend the work done so far to two important multi-computer types: Massively Parallel Machines and Clusters of Workstations. The former can be considered as one of the most powerful machines available nowadays. The second type of machines intends to provide computation power at a moderate price because they can exploit existing installations, but research will be necessary to adapt the algorithm design techniques to the specific characteristics of these configurations.</P>
