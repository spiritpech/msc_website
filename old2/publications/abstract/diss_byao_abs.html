This dissertation focuses on the high performance robust control of nonlinear systems in the
 presence of parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities (e.g., disturbances) and 
its application to the control of mechanical systems. A new approach, adaptive robust contro
l (ARC), is proposed. The approach effectively combines the design techniques of adaptive co
ntrol (AC) and deterministic robust control (DRC) and improves performance by preserving the
 advantages of both AC and DRC. Specifi- cally, the approach guarantees a superior performan
ce in terms of both transient error and final tracking accuracy in the presence of parametri
c uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities. This result overcomes the drawbacks of AC and 
makes the approach attractive to real applications. Through parameter adaptation, the approa
ch achieves asymptotic tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties without using a 
high-gain in the feedback loop, which implies that the control input is smooth. In this sens
e, ARC has a better tracking performance than DRC. The design is conceptually simple and ame
nable to implementation.
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A general framework of the proposed ARC is formulated in terms of adaptive robust control (A
RC) Lyapunov functions. Through backstepping design, ARC Lyapunov functions can be successfu
lly constructed for a large class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems trans
formable to a semi-strict feedback form.
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The method is applied to the control of robot manipulators in several applications. For traj
ectory tracking control, two ARC algorithms are developed: adaptive sliding mode control (AS
MC) and desired compensation ARC (DCARC). ASMC is based on the sliding mode control (SMC) an
d the conventional adaptation law that uses the actual state variables in the regressor. DCA
RC uses the desired trajectory information in the regressor. Three different adaptive or rob
ust control schemes are also derived for comparison: a simple nonlinear PID type robust cont
rol, a gain-based nonlinear PID type adaptive control, which requires no model information, 
and a combined parameter and gainbased adaptive robust control. All the algorithms are imple
mented and compared on a two-link direct drive robot. Comparative experimental results show 
the importance of the controller structure and the parameter adaptation. The proposed DCARC 
is found to provide the best tracking performance without increasing the control bandwidth a
nd the control effort.
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For a constrained robot manipulator, the end-effector of which is in contact with rigid surf
aces, a new constrained dynamic model is obtained to account for the effect of contact surfa
ce friction. The ARC scheme utilizes a PI type force feedback control structure with a low p
roportional gain to avoid the^L

2 acausality problem. Possible impact problems caused by losing contact are alleviated by th
e guaranteed transient performance. An adaptation law driven by both motion and force tracki
ng errors guarantees asymptotic motion and force tracking without any persistent excitation 
conditions. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the method.
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For the coordinated control of multiple robot manipulators handling a constrained object, a 
set of transformed dynamic equations are obtained in the joint space. In the transformed dom
ain, internal force and external contact force have the same form and can be dealt with in t
he same way as in the constrained motion problem. A coordinated motion and force ARC control
ler is developed. It possesses the same nice properties as the ARC constrained motion contro
ller mentioned above.
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Motion and force tracking control of robot manipulators in contact with unknown stiffness en
vironments is formulated. An ARC motion and force controller is developed to deal with unkno
wn robot parameters and surface parameters, such as stiffness and friction coefficients, as 
well as uncertain nonlinearities caused by modeling errors.
