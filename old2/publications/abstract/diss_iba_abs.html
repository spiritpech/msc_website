<p>The LMI (linear matrix inequality)-based H-infinity controller
synthesis theory guarantees that if the controller is allowed to
have the same order as the plant, and every system matrix of the
controller is freely tunable, then the H-infinity optimization
problem can be solved by convex optimization and the global
optimum can be always found. This dissertation focuses on an
extension of H-infinity optimization theories to the problems
that cannot be parameterized as a convex optimization problem.

<p>This dissertation first presents an extension of the LMI-based
H-infinity controller synthesis
algorithm for full-order controllers to fixed structure
controllers. A critical limitation of the LMI-based full-order H-infinity
controller synthesis algorithm is that it allows no additional
constraint to be imposed on the problem; the closed-loop H-infinity 
norm constraint must be the only
constraint imposed on the problem in order for it to be globally
solvable by convex optimization. In the case where the controller has
a fixed structure and only its parameters are tunable, the problem
cannot be reparameterized as a convex optimization problem. The
proposed algorithm starts from the transformation of the fixed-structure
H-infinity controller optimization problem into an H-infinity
optimization problem of a static output feedback controller. Then, the
cone complementarity linearization algorithm is used to locally solve
the H-infinity optimization problem of a static output feedback controller.

<p>Based on the proposed H-infinity optimization
algorithm, this dissertation demonstrates a tuning method of
controller parameters to explicitly design frequency responses of the
closed-loop system. The proposed approach offers an intuitive and efficient
way to re-tune controller parameters, which were finely tuned by an
expert engineer, and improve the control performance. 
The following three practical application examples are presented:
1) the tuning of a single-input single-output (SISO) PID (Proportional
plus Integral plus Derivative) controller for head positioning of a magnetic hard disk
drive (HDD), 2) the tuning of a discrete-time observer feedback
controller for head positioning of an HDD, and 3) the tuning of a
multi-input single-output (MISO) PI (Proportional plus Integral)
controller for the lateral control of an automated heavy-duty vehicle
(HDV). The effectiveness of the proposed re-tuning method is demonstrated by
simulation and experimentation.

<p>Secondly, this dissertation considers the BMI (bilinear matrix inequalities)
formulation of H-infinity optimization problems. The BMI framework offers an unified approach to
formulate a further general class of H-infinity optimization
problems with arbitrary constraints or additional optimization objectives. 
BMI problems are generally
nonconvex optimization problems and are proven to be NP-hard.
This dissertation proposes a novel local search approach for solving
general BMI problems. The proposed algorithm is based on the
semidefinite programming (SDP)
relaxation approach to BMI problems and the linearization-based local
search algorithm, which is analogous to the algorithm employed to
solve reduced-order H-infinity controller synthesis problems.
Four numerical experiments are conducted to show the
search performance of the proposed approach.

<p>Finally, the proposed fixed-structure H-infinity optimization algorithm is
applied to the H-infinity optimization problem of state
observers. First, the H-infinity optimization algorithm of Luenberger-type state
observers is presented. The proposed approach is applied to the design of fault
detection filters for lateral control of automated passenger
vehicles. The H-infinity optimization of Luenberger state observers is
then extended to the design of more general
mismatched state observers (i.e. system matrices of the observer do
not necessarily coincide with those of the plant model), and a novel
application of H-infinity-optimal mismatched state observers to
the observer-based feedback control is presented. 
The mismatched state observer is tuned by using H-infinity
optimization such that it not only provides
good estimation of state variables of the plant, but also stabilizes
the overall closed-loop system under the feedback linearization
control scheme. As an application example, the
proposed approach is applied to lateral control of
HDVs.
