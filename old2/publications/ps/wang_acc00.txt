Abstract 
This paper deals with the robust, gain-scheduled, later- 
al control problem for tractor-semitrailer combination ve- 
hicles (TSCVs) using an observer-structured H1 loop- 
shaping controller. Vehicle longitudinal speed is chosen as 
the scheduling parameter since variations of speeds dra- 
matically change system dynamics in dierent frequency 
ranges. By utilizing the vehicle speed as the scheduling 
parameter, the controller minimizes the eect of uncer- 
tainties and nonlinearities, which depends mainly on the 
velocity. Two scheduling techniques are applied to evalu- 
ate the eectiveness of the proposed controller. Simulation 
shows that the gain-scheduled controller generally sustains 
a larger robstness region than the xed-gain 199 420 239 433
