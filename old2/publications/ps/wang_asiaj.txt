Abstract 
In this paper, we present various linear analyses of the linearized lateral dynamics of heavy-duty 
vehicles (HDVs) (tractor-semitrailer type), which include time domain, frequency domain and pole/zero 
analyses. These analyses are conducted to examine the vehicle response to the steering input subject to 
variations of speed, road adhesion coe∆cient, cargo load in the trailer, and look-ahead distance for the 
lateral deviation sensor. These parameters (uncertainties) have signicant inuence on vehicle dynamics. 
It has been shown that redening the look-ahead lateral error as the controlled output has a favorable 
impact on the lateral control problem. Based on these analyses, a robust steering controller using H1 
loop-shaping procedure is designed for a tractor semitrailer combination to follow the road center line 
on both curved and straight highway sections. The proposed controller ensures the robust performance 
under model uncertainties which include varying vehicle longitudinal speed, road adhesion coe∆cient, 
and cargo load in the trailer. The performance of the designed controller is evaluated by simulations and 
validated by experiments.
