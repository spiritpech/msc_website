<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Motion Control</H2>

<P>Motion control is a broad topic that is of importance to many
areas. Key control challenges are to achieve high speed, high
precision/accuracy, adn maintain robust performance. To use
manufacturing application as an example, increased speed allows an
increased production rate, increased precision/accuracy allows the
fabricatoin of higher quality products, and maintaining robust
performance assures consistent product quality. Good examples are
items such as gears, machined parts, semiconductors, electronic
packaging, and many others.</P>

<P>Within this industry, serveral key technological advances are
taking place. More powerful processors are allows more advanced
control algorithm to be used. Advances in actuators, such as direct
drive motors, linear motors, adn brushless motors are reducing
traditional difficulties such as backlash, friction, and parasitic
system dynamics. Advances is power semiconductors are allowing these
new actuators to be driven in a more power-efficient and
cost-effective fashion. Advences in bearing systems, particularly for
low load situations such as fluid and magnetic bearings, are also
reducing the effects of friction and stiction. Promising new materials
such as composites and ceramics offer potential benefits in mechanical
properties such as lowering mass, improving damping, and reduction in
thermal effects. Finally, advences in sensors, due primarily to new
techniques in optics, electronics, and signal processing, are allowing
designers to get better feedback measurements.</P>

<P>Our research om this area hopes to extend and apply these advances,
particularly from the control standpoint. Current projects are
described in this section.</P>
