<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Vehicle Dynamics and Control</H2>

<P>Electronics and control have become major elements of modern
automobiles. Their use is not limited to control of a vehicle unit. In
1986, the
<A HREF="http://www.dot.ca.gov/">California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)</A>
and the
<A HREF="http://www.its.Berkeley.EDU/">Institute of Transportation Studies</A>
at the University of California at
Berkeley established the
<A HREF="http://www.path.Berkeley.EDU/">PATH (Partnaers for Advances Transit and Highways)</A>
program to investigate the applicability of advanced highway
automation, communication, and roadway electrification
technologies. Controls have been identified to be critical in the PATH
program, and various projects are in progress in the area of AVCS
(Advanced Vehicle Control Systems).</P>

<P>Under the PATH progrem, our group has been conducting research on
vehicle lateral guidance. So far, it has covered many issues related
to lateral guidance, including the development of accurate nonlinear
models of all types of vehicles as well as developinh advenced control
algorithm. We have conducted research projects on the automated lane
following problem, the lane change maneuvering problem, and the
traction control problem. A full=sized test vehicle using a discrete
magnetic marker track as a reference/sensing system has been
successfully implemented on a test track at the Richmond Field Station
of the University of California at Berkeley. A fail-safe investigation
has been conducted to diagnose system failures, such as sensor
mulfunction or tire bursts, and to bring the vehicle under control in
these emergency situatoins. Also, research is being conducted to
explore the effects of combining both longitudinal and lateral control
to a vehicle. Current reaerch projects are described in this
section.</P>
