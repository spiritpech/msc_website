<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Data Storage Systems</H2>

<P>The date storage industry integrates technology from several areas,
most notably electronics, magnetics, materials, and
mechanics. Products include magnetic disk drives, optical disk drives,
and tape drives. The current industry trend is to continue to refine
the existing technologies. A key aspect of this refinement is the
reduction of the physical size of drive systems. As the size is
reduced and the number of portable applications increases, the
robustness of the drive system becomes increasingly important.</P>

<P>As the size decreases, the performance of the servo system must
increase to accommodate the more dense track spacing. Futhermore, the
drive must maintain a rapid seek and settle performance. To increase
tracking servo performance, novel methods for position encoding and
detection are current research areas. Control methods such as the use
of robust design tools, algorithms for runout cancellation,
self-calibration and tuning, and disturbance sensing and rejection are
current topics. For larger systems such as tape drives and disk
arrays, control techniques for multi-input and multi-output systems
and control algorithm for motion synchronization hold promice.</P>

<P>Our group has been or is currently investigating several of these
control techniques. This work is in collaboration with the
<A HREF="http://cml.ME.Berkeley.EDU/">Computer Mechanics Laboratory</A>
within the
<A HREF="http://www.ME.Berkeley.EDU/">Mechanical Engineering Department</A>,
which addresses mechanical issues in data storage devices. Current
projects are described in this section.</P>
