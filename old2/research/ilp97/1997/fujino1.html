<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>SOFT COMPUTING APPROACH TO STOCHASTIC/DYNAMIC SCHEDULING PROBLES</H2>

<H3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</H3>

<P>Scheduling problems represent complex combinatorial optimization
problems because the search space increases exponentially with the
problem size. A well-known example is the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP). However, the TSP does not address many of the issues found in
the Real World: uncertainty, randomness and dynamics in the
information or environment. This project aims to formalize the
Garage-Sale Problem (GSP) as a framework for scheduling problems with
uncertainty and randomness. The GSP will be structured as an expansion
of the TSP that incorporates stochastic uncertainty and time dependent
dynamics. Also, this project aims to develop efficient algorithms for
generating solutions to the GSP. This project represents joint research
between the Mechanical System Control Laboratory of the Mechanical
Engineering Department and the Berkeley Initiative in Soft Computing
(BISC) group of the Computer Science Division.</P>

<H3>METHODOLOGY</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Apply and compare soft computing optimization methods
       (i.e. Genetic Algorithms, Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing) with hard
       computing methods such as Dynamic Programing.
  <LI>Expand the Traveling Salesman Problem by adding multi-objective
       evaluation, stochastic uncertainty and time dependent dynamics.
  <LI>Employ fuzzy information granulation to manage uncertain information.
</UL>

<H3>RESULTS TO DATE</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Compared basic performances of optimization methods applied to
       the Traveling Salesman Problem.
  <LI>TSP expanded to include multiple evaluation with costs and rewards.
  <LI>Simplified instances of the Garage-sale Problem and techniques
       to solve them have been constructed.
</UL>
