<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>MULTIRATE CONTROLLER FOR HARD DISK DRIVE</H2>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Takeyori Hara</P>

<H3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</H3>

<P>Recent growth in the track density of hard disk drives has required
higher controller bandwidth. On the other hand, the paradigm of servo
format methods has shifted from dedicated servo to embedded servo even
in high-end disk drives which have many (4 to 10) disks. This causes a
tradeoff problem between sampling rate and date format efficiency. The
multirate estimation-output controller is one approach to achieve
higher control bandwidth under lower sampling frequency by updating
the input signal at a higher frequency than the sampling frequency for
the tracking error. The input signal is updated based on an estimated
state between two sampling instances. The multi-rate ratio (MRR) is
defined by (Input Update Frequency)/(Output Sampling Frequency).  The
method has been successfully implemented in some commercial
products. However, further analysis is required for future disk drives
in particular for increased MRR implementations. This project will
examine advantage and theoretical limit of multirate controller, and
develop design and implementation method suitable for the actual
drives.</P>

<H3>METHODOLOGY</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Implement multirate controller in a disk drive and compare with
       high and low frequency single-rate controller.
  <LI>Simulate frequency response of an ideal multirate controller and
       compare with actual drive.
  <LI>Evaluate the influence of time delay and develop a method to
       minimize its influence.
  <LI>Evaluate the influence of model error/perturbation.
  <LI>Develop a auto tuning method for estimator coefficients to
       minimize the model error.
</UL>

<H3>RESULTS TO DATE</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Complete a hardware setup and tested a multirate control scheme
       with MRR=4.
  <LI>Compared with single-rate controller in magnitude of tracking
       run-out and frequency response.
  <LI>Simulated frequency response and compared with experimental
       results.
</UL>
