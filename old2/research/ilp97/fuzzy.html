<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Fuzzy Systems</H2>

<P>Since the first reported successful application of fuzzy systems
theory to feedback control in the mid 1970s, applications of fuzzy
control have steadily increased. Although the approach is often
referred to as fuzzy control, it has two components: "rule or logic
base" and "fuzzy set theory." Experts' knowledge of good strategic
ideas can often be described by a set of linguistic rules. The
development of rules for a controlled plant is supported by the
designer's good understanding of how the system works. Fuzzy set
theory provides a means to transform a set of rules to a computer
implementable control algorithm. The most notable applications are the
wide variety of commercial products in Japan which use fuzzy rule base
control and technology. Europe and the United States are also showing
increased interest inthe technology in industrial automation as well
as commercial products.</P>

<P>In contrast to traditional approaches for the design and analysis
of control systems, which begin with mathematical models that describe
the dynamics of the physical system to be controlled, the fuzzy rule
base design approach was introduced to bypass explicit mathematical
modeling and analysis. Two things should be noted here: one is that
the designer must have a model (implicit model) although it may not be
in a differential equation form, and the other is that the fuzzy
linquistic rule base is a friendly interface to human experts in order
to describe and convert his/her knowledge to control algorithms. In
fact, good "engineering" or "ideas" appears to be the basis behind
successful implementations of fuzzy control. The use of a fuzzy rule
base approach is not limited to a signal regulation level, which is
often only one aspect of control/automation systems. Fuzzy logic is an
attractive method for higher level control such as coordination fo
various sub-controllers, each of which is designed for a different
objective. A simple but instructive example for this is the
swinging-up and stabilization of an inverted pendulum. Fuzzy
counterparts of various control methodologies, such as predictive
control and adaptive control, have been reported. While the fuzzy
counterparts do not necessarily use the same, or even similar,
algorithm as the conventional methodologies, the motivation and goal
are common. It is expected that increased attention will be directed
to the blending of conventional control and fuzzy control. In fact,
the design of the fuzzy control algorithm can often be developed based
on the experience and knowledge of experts such as plant operators,
engineers, and plant designers.</P>

<P>Our research focuses on exploiting the unique features of fuzzy
rule base control systems to real applications. Current research
projects are described in this section.</P>
