<P>Mechanical systems are becoming increasingly reliant on
sophisticated methods of sensing, signal processing, and control to
improve performance. Machine tools, vehicles, data storage devices,
and positioning systems are but a few examples. At the same time,
rapid developments in microelectronics and computing have made it
possible to use a broad spectrum of signal processing and control
methods in real-time in a very cost-effective fashion. It is likely
that many future advances in mechanical systems will depend upon
further application of sophisticated control systems.</P>

<P>My research group addresses a broad range of topics in the general
area of control systems. These include applied mathematical analysis,
computer simulation, and hardware/software implementation. The title
<U>Control of Mechanical Systems</U> reflects the fact that mechanical
systems are the fundamental devices at the center of each
project. Theoretical research is pursued in control methodologies such
as adaptive and learning control, optimal control, robust control,
fuzzy control, nonlinear control, and system
identification. Application oriented research concerns robotics,
machining centers, precision X-Y positioning systems, intelligent
vehicle highway systems, and data storage devices. It is a Berkeley
tradition to blend theory and application and this tradition can be
found in almost all of the projects in my group.</P>

<P>The department offers a variety of courses at the graduate level to
help prepare students for advanced research and development work.
Examples include courses in linear sustems theory, digital control,
modeling and identification, nonlinear control, adaptive control,
real-time software, application of microcontrollers for signal
processing and control, manufacturing system processes, and
robotics. I encourage my students to broaden their backgrounds by
taking relevant courses in other departments such as Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science, as well as Mathematics.</P>

<P>This document provides a brief outline of research projects
conducted during the 1996-1997 academic year. This work has been
sponsored by a number of sources in government and industry. In
prticular, I wish to express my gratitude to the industrial sponsors
who have generously supported our research. Furthermore, they have
offered valuable insight and suggestions that habe helped focus our
efforts in critical areas. I believe that this interaction between the
university and industry is important in maintaining a strong research
program which addresses fundamental issues and yet remains relevant to
current engineering challenges Finally, I welcome quistions and
comments, Thank you.</P>
