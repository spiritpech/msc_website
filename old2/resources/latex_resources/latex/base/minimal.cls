% This documentclass is intended primarily for testing and reference
% purposes; loading it with \LoadClass{minimal} to use it as a base
% class for some other document class is probably a mistake. If you wish
% to start a new document class based on the minimal class, it is better
% to start by copying the *contents* of minimal.cls directly into your
% new class and making suitable modifications. You may, at that point
% also want to start documenting the code using the conventions of the
% doc package, rather than using simple ascii comments as used here.
