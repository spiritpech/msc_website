<p><b><big>Research Interests:</big></b></p>
 
<p>Tomizuka's  research covers control theory and its applications to various mechanical  systems.&nbsp; A balance between theory and  laboratory work is emphasized.&nbsp; The trend  in mechanical system design is to replace mechanical complexity with  electronics and computers (real time controllers) in order to gain high  performance, reliability and flexibility.&nbsp;  A number of control methodologies relevant to mechanical systems are  under investigation in his research group:&nbsp;  they include optimal control, preview control, identification and  adaptive control, nonlinear robust control and learning control.&nbsp; Since these control methodologies are  implemented on computers, the discrete time (digital) aspect is emphasized in  the development of theory.&nbsp; Actual  mechanical systems currently under study include robots, precision motion  control systems, computer disk file systems and automotive vehicles.</p>
